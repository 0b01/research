# Chapter 21 Numerical Example
## Introduction
This folder contains a notebook that uses functions from `mlfinlab.brute_force` to execute the numerical example from chapter 21 in "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado.

## Quantum Computing
Chapter 21 notes that large portfolio optimization problems are computationally intensive. Traditional numerical solvers and gradient descent methods can come to locally-optimal solutions, but ultimately nothing is a replacement for a true global search. Such a search in high-dimensional spaces can take extremely long times, even on modern computing clusters. Quantum annealing and quantum computing are alternative paradigms that allow all solution spaces to be explored simultaneously, generating a result that is the true global optimum. Within the last few years a number of companies have made quantum computing resources available via cloud services.
